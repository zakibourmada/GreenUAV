# GreenUAV - microcontrollerENV Flight Control FW 

![GreenUAV Logo](GreenUAV.png)

GreenUAV is a flight control firmware written in C/C++ for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), designed to explore the realms of UAV autonomy, control logic, sensors, actuators, and safety measures in aerial robotics.

## Features

- **Autonomous Flight Control:** Implement advanced control algorithms to achieve stable and precise flight.
- **Sensor Integration:** Integrate various sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and altimeters for accurate data processing.
- **Actuator Control:** Develop control strategies for actuators, such as servos, motors, and thrusters.
- **Flight Modes:** Support multiple flight modes, from manual control to fully autonomous operation.
- **Safety Mechanisms:** Implement fault detection and recovery procedures to ensure safe operation.
- **Communication Interfaces:** Integrate communication protocols to exchange data with ground stations and telemetry systems.
